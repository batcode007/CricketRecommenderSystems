DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF DATA FILES
==============================================

Here are brief descriptions of the data.

u.data     -- The full u data set, ______ ratings by _____ users on 42 items.
              Each user has rated at least 20 cricketers.  Users and items are
              numbered consecutively from 1.  The data is randomly
              ordered. This is a tab separated list of 
	         user id | item id | rating. 

u.info     -- The number of users, items, and ratings in the u data set.

u.item     -- Information about the items (cricketers); this is a tab separated
              list of
              cricketer id | cricketer name | Age | Indian |
              Pakistani | South African | Australian | West-Indian | Sri-Lankan |
              Bowler | Batsman | WicketKeeper | 
              The last 03 fields are the types of player and the 06 fields before that depicts the nationality, a 1 indicates the cricketer
              belongs to that field, a 0 indicates it doesn't
              The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

u.user     -- Demographic information about the users; this is a tab
              separated list of
              user id | name  |  age | gender | zip code
              The user ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.


u1.base    -- The data sets u1.base and u1.test through u5.base and u5.test
u1.test       are 80%/20% splits of the u data into training and test data.
u2.base       Each of u1, ..., u5 have disjoint test sets; this if for
u2.test       5 fold cross validation (where you repeat your experiment
u3.base       with each training and test set and average the results).
u3.test       These data sets can be generated from u.data by mku.sh.
u4.base
u4.test
u5.base
u5.test

ua.base    -- The data sets ua.base, ua.test, ub.base, and ub.test
ua.test       split the u data into a training set and a test set with
ub.base       exactly 10 ratings per user in the test set.  The sets
ub.test       ua.test and ub.test are disjoint.  These data sets can
              be generated from u.data by mku.sh.

allbut.pl  -- The script that generates training and test sets where
              all but n of a users ratings are in the training data.

mku.sh     -- A shell script to generate all the u data sets from u.data.
